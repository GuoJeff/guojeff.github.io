title: "Improving de novo molecular design with curriculum learning"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/Curriculum-Learning.md
excerpt: "Here, we implement curriculum learning in REINVENT (generative molecular design with reinforcement learning) to decompose complex molecular design objectives into a sequence of simpler intermediate tasks. Compared to standard reinforcement learning, target objective convergence can be greatly accelerated."
