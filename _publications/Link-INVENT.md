excerpt: "Link-INVENT is an extension of REINVENT (generative molecular design with reinforcement learning) for the design of chemical linkers between two molecular sub-units. Link-INVENT is suitable for fragment linking, scaffold hopping, and PROTAC linker design and allows explicit control over optimizing linker-specific properties such as length."
