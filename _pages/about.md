I am a 1st year PhD student advised by Professor Philippe Schwaller at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne ([EPFL](https://github.com/schwallergroup)), applying data-driven methods for accelerated chemical discovery. Previously, I was a cheminformatics researcher in the [Molecular AI team](https://github.com/MolecularAI) with Professor Ola Engkvist at AstraZeneca where I developed generative models for molecular design. My undergraduate degree was in chemistry, inspiring my research to harness domain expertise to augment machine learning methods for chemical discovery.
